# AstroVault-MiniProject
AstroVault is a front-end web development project designed to showcase creativity and interactivity through a clean and user-friendly interface. The website consists of multiple sections, including a Home page with a welcoming hero section, a Products page highlighting featured items with stock-check functionality, an About Us/Contacts page with a working form and social links, and a Chatbot page featuring a simple interactive bot.
Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project demonstrates essential skills such as DOM manipulation, form validation, dynamic alerts, event handling, and responsive layouts. The chatbot, while basic, introduces the concept of AI-driven interaction through conditional responses, while the stock-checking system adds functional logic to product cards.
AstroVault serves as a practical learning project for beginners exploring modern front-end technologies. It balances design and functionality, making it a great example of how fundamental web concepts can be combined to create a polished, engaging, and interactive website experience.
